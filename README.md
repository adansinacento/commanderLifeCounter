# commanderLifeCounter
A simple apple watch app to track your own life for commander. Or any kind of counter really.

Given that it is a single file I figured I would upload only ([the main file](watchApp.swift)) instead of all the application files. This repo is open to PRs if you want to do anything with it.

Features:
* Visualization of remaining life and +/- buttons (obiously)
* Press and hold a button to keep modifying life 10 at a time
* Digital crown rotation to modify life quicker


I dont usualy develop in Swift so I'm unsure of naming conventions and stuff, any doubt or inquiry of any type HMU @ [twitter](https://twitter.com/AdanSinAcento)
